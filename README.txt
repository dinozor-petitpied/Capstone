Project Overview

In this project, I am interested in studying the heterogeneity of Non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. Until recently, the tumor gene expression was achieved with measurement on bulk cells. However, the emergence of resistance to some treatments raised the importance of tumor heterogeneity in the resistance mechanism appearance. Tumor heterogeneity refers to the high diversity of cells showing different gene expression levels.
Single-cell analysis techniques have revolutionized the ability to study this heterogeneity by allowing the examination of the characteristics of individual cells rather than averaging them out in bulk assays. 

Dataset

A single-cell dataset containing 11 samples has been made available on Kaggle:
- 3 DLBCL (malignant)
- 3 Follicular Lymphoma (malignant)
- 2 transformed lymphoma (malignant)
- 3 reactive lymph nodes (non-malignant)
